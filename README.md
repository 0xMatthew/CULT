# About CULT

CULT is a project name for a collaborative quantum mechanics simulation simulation. The goal of CULT is to simulate environments and their objects using quantum mechanics to predict the future state of a system.

This project will focus on leveraging the power of both classical computing and quantum computing to simulate the future state of a system. Initially, the project will focus on simulating very small systems of 2-level qauntum systems such as the spin of an electron, energy levels of an atom, or polarization states of a photon, as these objects exhibit quantum properties that qubits in quantum computers are able to simulate. Additionally, such systems are small enough that they can be simulated on classical computers.

The project is currently in a research-heavy phase. While CULT determines the current limitations of quantum computing and classical computing quantum simulations and their frameworks, tangible action items will be added to the project roadmap.
